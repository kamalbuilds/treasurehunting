Lightlink Treasure Quest: An Epic Blockchain Adventure with Perion XP points

Embark on an unparalleled adventure in the mystical world of Lightlink, a realm where treasures abound and dangers lurk in the shadows. In this groundbreaking treasure hunting game, you are not just a playerâ€”you are a pioneer in a digital frontier, crafting your destiny with every decision.

- Begin Your Legend

1. Forge Your Hero: Enter the realm by minting your unique character as an NFT (ERC-1155), a digital artifact that signifies your presence and prowess in the world of Lightlink.
2. Arm Yourself for Glory: Venture into the arcane Shop, where weapon NFTs (another ERC-1155 contract) await those daring enough to wield their power. Choose your weapon wisely, for it will be your companion in the quests to come.
3. Prepare for the Hunt: With weapon in hand, "equip" (stake) it in the legendary [TreasureHunt](./contracts/contracts/TreasureHunt.sol) contract. 
4. Here, your journey truly begins as you start to earn "XP points" (ERC-20 tokens), the lifeblood of your ascent to greatness.

Ascend Through the Ranks

Your valor and strategy will earn you XP points, the currency of progress and power in Lightlink. These tokens are not just markers of your journey; they are keys to unlocking greater challenges and rewards. 

Use them to acquire higher-tier weapons, each imbued with the potential to amplify your rewards per block, marking your rise from a novice adventurer to a legendary treasure hunter.

For instance, acquiring the "Level 2 Sword" (token ID `1`) for a mere 10 XP points elevates your rewards, leveraging the formula:

```js
(1 + 1)  10_000_000_000_000 / 100_000_000_000_000_000 XP points per block.
```

This intricate mechanism ensures that every action in the game is not just a step forward but a leap towards legendary status.
